The first chapter encourages the player community to work together while strategically competing with one another as they explore Wonder Game and find magical SHROOMs, which allows them to create and collect in-game items - boosting creativity and social interaction, all while bringing different ecosystems together.\n\n\nThe rabbit hole into every new chain will allow players to upgrade their Character NFT and explore the new chain and chapter with new goals. The intrinsic value - through collective exploration, learnings on new chains, and imaginative creation from the community - will extend the reach of the Wonder Game ecosystem.\n\n\nPhase 1 Overview: Wander the Wonder\n\n\nThe first phase will revolve around exploring the Queen\u00b4s maze. The goal is to gather valuable in-game items and $SHROOM. Some will be useful immediately and others will be of value when 'Empire' launches (Phase 2).\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThis map will be the setting for the maze game. It has different types of regional terrains hosting different types of mazes. For now(Phase I), there will be one area that will be available.\n\n\nA region may have multiple areas. Each hexagon represents an area. After a maze is created, it changes periodically. Players can place one Queen NFT in an area, thereby creating the Queen\u2019s Maze. \n\n\nThe goal for players with Queen NFTs is to have Alices and Cards go through their maze and collect rewards for Empire. The area selected will represent a player\u2019s kingdom for the duration of the epoch. Subsequently, a maze will magically form around the palace. And for the players with Cards and Alices, the goal is to find new mazes and explore to find items and SHROOM in the maze. The Queen also receives 30% of these rewards. Players can choose to place a Queen and get rewards passively or use their Cards and Alice NFTs to get rewards actively.\n\n\nThe items and SHROOM will be taken on a first-come, first-serve basis. This makes finding and exploring new mazes all the more important!\n\n\n \nCharacters introduction \nCharacter NFTs each have their own role in Wonder Game. They are utility-based NFTs that will allow you to stake, explore and upgrade them in Wonder Game. There is a total of 10,000 Character", "doc_id": "a91f2f6c-9ab4-4011-a878-6fec34f2e57f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "913e96f6d25e935b6681452b08a15910355f35de380cbeabb335b9c3c89bdf37", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3272, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "9b85d6b5-7e6f-4d5f-9fb1-e540dba86470", "3": "d58950f5-22c5-4697-bb5f-88afec19b8df"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d58950f5-22c5-4697-bb5f-88afec19b8df": {"__data__": {"text": "kingdom for the duration of the epoch.

They are utility-based NFTs that will allow you to stake, explore and upgrade them in Wonder Game. There is a total of 10,000 Character NFTs allocated for Chapter 1. This utility changes as they move through new chapters.\n\n\nYou can strategize with friends and explore Wonder Game to find the best place to accumulate SHROOM.\n\n\nEach character has its own stats that you can upgrade to get higher skills and better in-game - the stats will stay with the Character NFT.\n\n\nCharacter types\nCards\nCards are the foot soldiers for the Queen. They are responsible for finding resources and protecting them from Alices. There are 7500 Cards available for Chapter 1.\n\n\n* Runner Club\n* Insomniac Diamond\n* Marker Spades\n* All-Rounder Heart[a][b]\n\n\nAlice\nAlice is the mischievous character that arrives in the Wonder Realm searching for the SHROOM. There are 1250 Alices in Chapter 1, making them pretty rare. \n\n\nQueen\nThe ruler of Wonder Realm, the Queen, orders the cards to collect resources for her. Similar to Alices, there are 1250 Queens in Chapter 1. \n\n\nThe chapter \u2018\u2019Character gameplay\u2019\u2019 contains a more elaborate description of their abilities.\n\n\nSHROOM Token\nSHROOM token ($SHROOM) is the native token of the Wonder Game, the magical power that runs the Wonder Game ecosystem. SHROOMs allow you to enter, own, use, participate, and govern Wonder Game.\n\n\n$SHROOM can be used to change your character\u2019s name and increase their stats. It can also be used to buy raffle tickets for Raffles and to bid on Auctions. Besides that, SHROOM is also a desired commodity in-game. \n\n\nThere are 3 different ways of acquiring SHROOM, other than buying it on QuickSwap. Finding SHROOM in the maze is the first one. However, Wonder Game also provides a Liquidity Pool and a shroom staking feature. \nContract Address: 0x35d112044D174Dd16Fee24d5C5CaB24F4f81cB41\n\n\n\n\n________________\nLore\nFollow the White Rabbit, and down and down you go. Down to the world of Wonderland, a magical place, a mystical place. The place that a young girl named Alice had traveled to, met all sorts of strange people, ate all sorts of strange things, and had all sorts of strange adventures. And then she woke up.\n\n\nTime flows differently in Wonderland. Centuries go on, yet no time passes. Things change, yet a lot is still remarkably the same. \n\n\nAlice returns, or maybe she wasn\u2019t gone at all. She notices a lot of change, and yet it feels almost too familiar. \n\n\nThe Queen of Hearts still resides in her Castle, ruling the realm with an Iron fist. A maze surrounds the Queen\u2019s Castle. Her gardens that the Card Soldiers attended to are now overgrown and with a life of their own, a deadly maze in their place. \n\n\nHow Curious then, that the one thing that should stand out, fits right in. A dark dreary maze, filled with horrors and wonders unimaginable feels par the course in this mad mad world. \n\n\nAlice doesn\u2019t brave entering the Maze, the Queen\u2019s domain. She seeks to visit her friend the Duchess first. The Duchess\u2019s house is a sprawling marketplace now, home to vendors selling all sorts of things.", "doc_id": "d58950f5-22c5-4697-bb5f-88afec19b8df", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c6d66b24bce16b15308443cd09c77d09e623d53f5d4b3cc959953fde238979c9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 2652, "end": 6332, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "9b85d6b5-7e6f-4d5f-9fb1-e540dba86470", "2": "a91f2f6c-9ab4-4011-a878-6fec34f2e57f", "3": "dd381caf-3028-4fb6-91d6-226f58c78e84"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd381caf-3028-4fb6-91d6-226f58c78e84": {"__data__": {"text": "of change, and yet it feels almost too familiar. \n\n\nThe Queen of Hearts still resides in her Castle, ruling the realm with an Iron fist.

She seeks to visit her friend the Duchess first. The Duchess\u2019s house is a sprawling marketplace now, home to vendors selling all sorts of things. \n\n\nThe Duchess smiles as Alice approaches, and invites her over to tea. \n\n\nTea is different without the Hatter\u2019s riddles, without the sleepy dormouse snoring, and Alice can\u2019t help the pang of sadness as she misses the Hare\u2019s stories. But she preservers and listens to the Duchess\u2019s tales. \n\n\nThe Duchess tells her about the sprawling maze and the dangers and treasures within. She tells about the Cards who had braved entering, of those who were trapped, and those who had returned with Chests of Treasure, and mystical items galore! \n\n\nAlice is an adventurer at heart, her mind is sharp and her Curiosity is peaked. She makes up her mind.  \n\n\nAlice stands looking at the entrance of the maze, and at the Queen\u2019s Castle, she spots in the middle. She slowly enters, preparing herself for whatever might appear. She would explore the maze, she would steer clear of the Cards. She is in a new Wonder Realm now, she can\u2019t trust anyone. \n\n\nShe has some food in her bag, some items that the nice Duchess handed her, and a resolve to find everything she can. \n\n\n\n\nWill she prevail, or will the Queen\u2019s soldiers get to the items first? Nothing is certain in this world of wonder, but lots of items are to be found, and lots of fun to be had. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nChapter One Gameplay \nChapter One of Wonder Game will launch in the Polygon blockchain. It consists of three different phases of the game. \n\n\nPhase 1: Maze Game- Wander the Wonder of the Maze, and collect all you can find!\nPhase 2: Empire- Every Queen needs her Empire, how will you build yours?\nPhase 3: Battle- Battle with the other Queens and grow your empire \nPhase 0.5: Maze Game- Pre-alpha \nBefore the release of Phase 1: Maze Game, we will have a mini maze game. This will utilize most of the components of Phase 1 and will be a pre-alpha version of the game. \n\n\nThere will be one singular maze that people can explore in the mini-game, and that would change periodically over an epoch of three days. Players will be able to enter the maze and search for items. While roaming around the maze, players burn their energy. They will have fixed energy to explore the maze. They will not be able to see another player in the maze while they are playing. \n\n\nMaze Stats\nMaze size: 1000x1000\nWalkable Area: 40-50%\nItems Drop Rate: 5%\n(These numbers are subject to change)\n\n\n\n\nCharacter NFTs: \nAll three Character NFTs will be able to explore the maze during this phase. This will not be true for any subsequent phase after this. Starting in Phase 1, Queens will remain in their castle, overseeing the Cards.\n\n\nCards, Queens and Alices will be able to roam the maze to find items and one special item hidden amongst the chests. One item that will be helpful to the Queen as she begins to create her own maze. \n\n\nEnergy: \nEvery Character will have some Energy to explore the maze. We will start with a certain amount of base Energy, and as you upgrade your NFT, your energy will increase. The Energy will be a weighted sum of the stats of the NFT.\nProvided", "doc_id": "dd381caf-3028-4fb6-91d6-226f58c78e84", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c6e00b097229339ce71afa44dbd8ca96dfd3b1dfe88b014ef7b4abb6cbff0bbf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 6382, "end": 10089, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "9b85d6b5-7e6f-4d5f-9fb1-e540dba86470", "2": "d58950f5-22c5-4697-bb5f-88afec19b8df", "3": "734675ce-2a3a-4fdc-816d-433d73a00796"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "734675ce-2a3a-4fdc-816d-433d73a00796": {"__data__": {"text": "40-50%\nItems Drop Rate: 5%\n(These numbers are subject to change)\n\n\n\n\nCharacter NFTs: \nAll three Character NFTs will be able to explore the maze during this phase.

We will start with a certain amount of base Energy, and as you upgrade your NFT, your energy will increase. The Energy will be a weighted sum of the stats of the NFT.\nProvided the fact that a fully upgraded Card contains a higher skill level than Alice, the total potential energy level for cards is higher.\nKeep in mind, in the later version of Phase 1, the Energy of NFT will be derived from the \u2018Stamina\u2019 stats, and the energy recharging mechanism will depend on \u2018Rest\u2019 stats.\nEnergy will recharge every 24 hours. Energy will regenerate at the same time for every NFT, at 12 pm UST. All energy changes as a result of upgrades will be in effect after 12 pm UST.\n\n\nItem Rewards: \nThere will be 2 types of items that you can get in this phase. \n  \n\nItem Drop rate for Phase 0.5(subject to change)\n\n\nFood: Scattered around the maze, there will be food items. The food must be consumed immediately after finding them. For this phase, there will only be one food item (Cupcake) giving you 15 energy.\n\n\nTreasure Crates: There will be three types of Treasure Crates available in this maze: Wooden, Gold, and Legendary. \n\n\nFor this phase, the crates will be just a collectible. You will not be able to open the Crates right away. As we get closer to the phase 1 game release, the crates and what they contain will be and will be airdropped to the corresponding NFT holders. \n\n\nThe items that can be found inside the maze will be in-game items and food. Legend has it that the Queen herself is roaming the maze searching for one elusive item. \n\n\nLeaderboard: \nThe leaderboard will be divided based on NFT type. We would have 6 leaderboards in total for Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Alices, and Queens. \n\n\nThe highest-performing scores are listed on the leaderboard on daily basis. The scores are calculated according to the no. of items and treasure chests collected by the user. \n\n\nOnly the best score from the wallet is tracked on the Leaderboard.\n \n\n\n\n\nPhase 1: Maze Game\nTagline: Wander the Wonder of the Maze\nMaze Game will be the first phase of the Wonder Game. The setting of this game is on different mazes in the Wonderland map. Inside each maze, you will find a Queen\u2019s Castle, and valuable items scattered around the maze. \n\n\nThe three Character NFTs will have their roles to play in the Maze as they wander the maze in search of items, and seek to build their Empire. \n\n\nThe Maze will be created once the Queen places herself in a position. Depending on her stats, the maze will have various resources. And if she has acquired the prestigious item \u2018Heart of the Maze\u2019, then the maze will be truly fortuitous indeed. She exacts a tax on the magical SHROOM that people will find, and also on a few items. \n\n\nThe Cards are roaming the maze at the behest of the Queen. They aim to find as many items and resources in the maze as they can. As they travel through the dreary maze, many prizes await them, and many traps do too. Once they enter the maze, they cannot exit until they find one of the exit portals. \n\n\nAlice is an explorer at heart, and she explores the maze, dodging the Queen\u2019s Card Soldiers and trying to get as many items as she can.

She chooses a location and places herself and her castle there. Through her power, there flows a maze with many great items hidden inside. She resides inside her castle, collecting taxes from the Cards that are exploring her maze. \n\n\nAlice: Maze Explorer\nAlice is an explorer at heart, and she is exploring the Queen\u2019s Maze to find the items before the Queen\u2019s Cards can. \n\n\nCards: Maze Soldiers\nCards are ever loyal to the Queen and they are exploring the maze at her behest, finding items and treasures within. They have to pay a 30% tariff to the Queen for the items that they find, but the rest is theirs to keep. \n\n\nItems\nItems in Phase 1 fall under two categories. Some items will be useful for Maze Game, and others will be used to build up Phase 2: Empire\n\n\nIn-maze Items\n\n\nThese items are useful for Maze Game and fall under two types: Food and Resources. These items can also be bought from the Marketplace. These items will be ERC-1155 tokens, but only a few of them will be tradable. \n\n\n\n\nFood\nitems are what give you extra energy inside the maze. They can be bought and consumed later on, or immediately consumed after finding. However, all foods go bad, and there will be an expiry timer for all of them. You have to use them before they expire. \n\n\nA tea party gone wrong or maybe gone right. Look at all these tasty items and take a bite.

Both Alice and Cards can trap other Alice and Cards. Traps can be both found during exploration and bought from the marketplace. \n\n\nHow do traps work? \n* In order to place a trap, players must have a trap in their inventory. They can place Traps anywhere in the maze. Players will not be entrapped in their own trap. If they place a trap ahead of them, then they can walk in that direction freely. The next user to come upon the trap will be trapped.\n\n\nWhat do Traps do? \nTraps have a baseline power level, and they can be increased in strength by using SHROOM. Items used to see traps also have this same concept. The higher the trap, the higher the item needs to be to see them. \n\n\nTraps will decrease the energy of an NFT by 20 energy. This number can be increased by increasing the strength of the traps. \n\n\nDuchess\u2019s Marketplace\nDuchess\u2019s Marketplace is a sprawling marketplace for all things helpful. Running out of Energy? Buy some food to last you in the Maze. Or maybe some items to help you find things better? Worry not, for the Duchess has you covered! \n\n\nThe Duchess\u2019s Marketplace will be available in the first phase. Only the food and in-game special items can be bought. You can buy them with SHROOM. Empire Items will not be sold in the marketplace. \n\n\n\n\nPhase 2: Empire\nEvery Queen needs her Empire, how will you build yours?\nEmpire is the Second Phase of Wonder Game, and it builds up from the resources you collected from the Maze Game. \n\n\nIn Phase 2, a Queen will build her Empire, and protect it from other Queens and Alices. To build an Empire, you would need to collect resources from the Maze. The items found in the Maze will not be sold on our marketplace but can be traded amongst players. \n\n\nThere will be various facets of the Empire, from building your Army with your Card Guards, collecting and building resources, and preparing your Empire. Imagine collaborating with other players, combining your strengths, and taking on a rivaling guild. \n\n\nAnd fear not, curious Alice will not be left behind in this Queendom, for she is just waiting for Queen\u2019s attention to be elsewhere so she can loot the precious SHROOM from inside the Queen\u2019s Castle. \n\n\nMore information on Empire will be released closer to the Phase 2 launch. \n\n\nPhase 3: Battle!\nBattle with the other Queens and grow your", "doc_id": "d0ad0cf7-5dad-4595-97bf-b5ca210e1105", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "23e8455aa40ce769e085b8a1d418c6a5d2be5ca3e111d908efcba4313e139a3a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 17646, "end": 21377, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "9b85d6b5-7e6f-4d5f-9fb1-e540dba86470", "2": "5d813b4f-e96f-4fd0-be08-90fcaa79628b", "3": "403c38ae-1e98-4add-9cd0-a36b31942faf"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "403c38ae-1e98-4add-9cd0-a36b31942faf": {"__data__": {"text": "Alices.

They are utility-based NFTs that will allow you to do various things with them in Wonder Game. This utility changes as they move through new chapters.\n* Each character has its own stats that you can upgrade to get higher skills and better in-game - the stats will stay with the Character NFT.\n* Duchess's Marketplace will allow you to buy and sell your Character NFT.\n* NFTs can be traded with both MATIC and our token SHROOM. \n\n\n\n\nCard Soldiers, Queen, and Alice\n\n\nOut of the total 10,000 NFTs - 75% are Cards, 12.5% Queens, and 12.5% Alices.\nThe PreSale mints were available with both ICX and Harmony ONE. The Mint has stopped, and the remaining Character NFTs is being raffled in the weekly raffles, and can also be bought at the daily auctions. \n\n\nThe collection of Character NFTs will only be 10,000. We are in the process of changing the Gen 1 and Gen 2 mints. More information on this will be revealed later. \n\n\nStats & Attributes\nAll three Character type has their own stats that can be upgraded - more in-depth in the enhancement section. Each Card Soldier type also has its unique upgradeable stats.\n\n\nXP\nExperience points can be earned by playing the game. In the maze game, each step taken in the game equals some amount of XP earned. \n\n\nIn order to upgrade your NFTs, you would need to play the game and earn XP. XP levels limit the number of upgrades you can do. As you play the game, earn XP, and increase your level, you can upgrade more. More on this is in the Enhancement section. \n\n\nCard\n\n\nStamina: Stamina determines how much Energy a Card has. \nRest: Rest decreases the regeneration time of Energy.\nGround: Ground Stat allows you to teleport into a location of your choosing in a certain radius. \nSector: Sector allows you to claim a sector for yourself for a certain time. During the duration, no other NFT can enter the Sector. \nPrestige: Prestige decreases the amount of tax a Card has to pay to the Queen\nLuck: Luck increases the chance of finding a rare item. \n(Note: These abilities are applicable for Maze Game, as we keep going into the Empire game, the abilities will be different and this section will be updated)\n\n\nSuit Specific Attributes\nRunner Club- This athletic soldier has more Energy to traverse Wonder Maze.\nInsomniac Diamond - This party animal requires less regeneration time to regenerate his Energy. \nMarker Spades- This land surveying soldier marks the camp area to claim all the prizes for himself. \nAll-Rounder Heart- This", "doc_id": "403c38ae-1e98-4add-9cd0-a36b31942faf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4b0161850cbee1b0451ea7d5ef6341bbf3c3764485b8698dc5081904b057230e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 21310, "end": 25235, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "9b85d6b5-7e6f-4d5f-9fb1-e540dba86470", "2": "d0ad0cf7-5dad-4595-97bf-b5ca210e1105", "3": "fd23d8c0-fff9-4c47-b44d-7999bde17247"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd23d8c0-fff9-4c47-b44d-7999bde17247": {"__data__": {"text": "choosing in a certain radius. \nSector: Sector allows you to claim a sector for yourself for a certain time.

There will be more items in the maze.\n\n\nAlice\nCuriosity: Curiosity often leads to better things, and here it sure does. This stat will give Alice a bigger advantage in Energy, finding items, and avoiding traps. \n\n\nStats for future phases\nAs we go along from the Maze game, to Empire and Battle and beyond, these stats will change in their abilities and powers. There might be new stats and new things that the NFTs can do!\n\n\nEnhancement\nXP & Potential \n\n\nIn order to upgrade the stats of your NFT, you would need to play the game and earn XP. To upgrade each stat, a certain amount of XP is required. With each upgrade, your character potential is also increased. \n\n\nWe have 6 levels of Character Potential. Each level of Potential comes with 12 sub-levels of its own. \n\n\nIt is possible to upgrade your NFTs right now, and max upgrades allow you to upgrade up to 2 out of 6 levels of Potential. No XP is needed for this, but once Phase 1 launches, you will need XP to upgrade each stat. The table of how much XP you will need to update will be released then. \n\n\nAfter the launch of Phase 1, the ones with maximum upgrades will start at a different XP and Character Potential level than the ones with zero upgrades. \n\n\nStat Upgrades\nIt is possible to upgrade Character NFTs before the game launch using SHROOM. No XP is needed at this stage. However, it is only possible to upgrade NFTs to 33% of their total level. \n\n\nThe max upgrades for all three types of NFTs are: \n\n\n\n\nQueen\n\n\nStat \n\tTotal \n\tCurrent Max\n\tOrder\n\t100\n\t33\n\t\n\nAlice\n\n\nStat \n\tTotal \n\tCurrent Max\n\tCuriosity\n\t100\n\t33\n\t\n\nCards\n\n\nStats\n\tMax\n\tClub\n\tDiamond\n\tSpades \n\tHeart\n\tStamina\n\t200\n\t120\n\t33\n\t33\n\t110\n\tRest\n\t100\n\t33\n\t120\n\t33\n\t110\n\tGround\n\t6\n\t0\n\t0\n\t2\n\t0.67\n\tSector\n\t150\n\t50\n\t50\n\t50\n\t50\n\tLuck\n\t100\n\t33\n\t33\n\t33\n\t33\n\tPrestige\n\t100\n\t33\n\t33\n\t33\n\t33\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\nGeneral\nWhat is Wonder Game?\nWonder Game is a Play-to-Earn, collaborative Defi game that takes players on a cross-chain adventure to different blockchains with different chapters.

Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the", "doc_id": "4d99e6ba-498c-4e08-ab8f-7895adb2795e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d1076b879ffd27f0bf7240af8085f1fbbf18b5ecdc56e6168347f5c8b3da425c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3429, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8b039200-9c65-40b1-b044-da4f5c165d4b", "3": "21574681-0e3a-4e77-b311-3b986eca6574"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "21574681-0e3a-4e77-b311-3b986eca6574": {"__data__": {"text": "she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \u201cI wonder how\nmany miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) \u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201d (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all\nthe right word) \u201c\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you\u2019re\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what\nan ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d\n\nDown, down, down.

Do cats eat bats?\u201d and\nsometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer\neither question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n\u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought\npoor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\nknew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\nindeed were really impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here\nbefore,\u201d said", "doc_id": "d772b2a1-1f57-406c-817f-c420a5c981fa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0d5b72845ae692530d653d7c8b6e4500ea2fa71b7355d710189ee6b1a780a71d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 6300, "end": 9729, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8b039200-9c65-40b1-b044-da4f5c165d4b", "2": "21574681-0e3a-4e77-b311-3b986eca6574", "3": "3c831e53-fe2c-4d95-8ffa-f4f53ff5a9ff"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c831e53-fe2c-4d95-8ffa-f4f53ff5a9ff": {"__data__": {"text": "get her head\nthrough the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought\npoor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders.

Which\nway?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\nThe Pool of Tears\n\n\n\u201cCuriouser and curiouser!\u201d cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201cnow I\u2019m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was!

It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like\nyou,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please,\nsir\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear!

Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am\nolder than you, and must know better;\u201d and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I\u2019ll_ soon make\nyou dry enough!\u201d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\nMouse in the middle.

There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and\naway,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\nsaid, \u201c_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n\u201cWhy, _she_, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\nconfused way, \u201cPrizes!

Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited.

Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\na fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\nmistake it had made.\n\n\u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran. \u201cHow\nsurprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him\nhis fan and gloves\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201d As she said this, she\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\nplate with the name \u201cW. RABBIT,\u201d engraved upon it. She went in without\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\nfan and gloves.\n\n\u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201c\u2018Miss Alice! Come\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute,\nnurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I\ndon\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house\nif it began ordering people about like that!\u201d\n\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\nthis time with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it\nand put it to her lips. \u201cI know _something_ interesting is sure to\nhappen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so\nI\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large\nagain, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t\ngrow any more\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t\ndrunk quite so much!\u201d\n\nAlas! it was too late to wish that!

What _will_ become of me?\u201d\n\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n\u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2014and yet\u2014and\nyet\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\nwhen I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a\nsorrowful tone; \u201cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more _here_.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cshall I _never_ get any older than I am\nnow? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way\u2014never to be an old woman\u2014but\nthen\u2014always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like _that!_\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you foolish Alice!\u201d she answered herself. \u201cHow can you learn\nlessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\nfor any lesson-books!\u201d\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n\u201cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201d said the voice. \u201cFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201d\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.

Pat! Where are you?\u201d And\nthen a voice she had never heard before, \u201cSure then I\u2019m here!

I think that\nwill be the best plan.\u201d\n\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\ngreat hurry.\n\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little\nthing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\nspite of all her coaxing.\n\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\nand till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n\n\u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\nleaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2014if I\u2019d\nonly been the right size to do it!

The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\nout into the open air. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take this child away with me,\u201d\nthought Alice, \u201cthey\u2019re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\u2019t it be\nmurder to leave it behind?\u201d She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n\u201cDon\u2019t grunt,\u201d said Alice; \u201cthat\u2019s not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.\u201d\n\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. \u201cBut perhaps it was only\nsobbing,\u201d she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears.\n\nNo, there were no tears. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\u201d\nsaid Alice, seriously, \u201cI\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you.

Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u201d\n\n\u201c_I_ call it purring, not growling,\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cCall it what you like,\u201d said the Cat. \u201cDo you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like it very much,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t been invited\nyet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see me there,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished.\n\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\nit suddenly appeared again.\n\n\u201cBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u201d said the Cat. \u201cI\u2019d nearly\nforgotten to ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt turned into a pig,\u201d Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\nin a natural way.\n\n\u201cI thought it would,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished again.\n\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. \u201cI\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u201d she\nsaid to herself; \u201cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.\u201d As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n\n\u201cDid you say pig, or fig?\u201d said the Cat.\n\n\u201cI said pig,\u201d replied Alice; \u201cand I wish you wouldn\u2019t keep appearing\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n\n\u201cWell! I\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cbut a\ngrin without a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u201d\n\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself \u201cSuppose it should be raving mad after all!\nI almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nA Mad Tea-Party\n\n\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u201cVery\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u201d thought Alice; \u201conly, as it\u2019s asleep,\nI suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it: \u201cNo room!

After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; \u201cand besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,\u201d thought she, \u201cif people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u201d So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.\n\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely \u201cWho is this?\u201d She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n\n\u201cIdiot!\u201d said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u201d said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, \u201cWhy, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after\nall.

Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\nshouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with her head!\u201d about once in a\nminute.\n\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n\u201cand then,\u201d thought she, \u201cwhat would become of me? They\u2019re dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\u2019s any\none left alive!\u201d\n\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself \u201cIt\u2019s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.\n\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s no use\nspeaking to it,\u201d she thought, \u201ctill its ears have come, or at least one\nof them.\u201d In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\nshe had someone to listen to her.

She soon\ngot it out again, and put it right; \u201cnot that it signifies much,\u201d she\nsaid to herself; \u201cI should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\ntrial one way up as the other.\u201d\n\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt.\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about this business?\u201d the King said to Alice.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cNothing _whatever?_\u201d persisted the King.\n\n\u201cNothing whatever,\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very important,\u201d the King said, turning to the jury.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n", "doc_id": "7bb8feba-cb4e-4074-9c81-35ab5a87c21f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "82efdb8c403efafec0c3674fbef1241c50b62f021c2fdf9ed428121d8a97526b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 199418, "end": 203077, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8b039200-9c65-40b1-b044-da4f5c165d4b", "2": "79e3a835-bd6e-4bcf-a1bb-b101803763b1"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
